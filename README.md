# gradcatalog-ai

A project involving web scraping the University of Delaware’s Computer and Information Sciences graduate catalog to create a structured dataset for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, enabling Google Gemini to answer queries based on the catalog’s contents.

I designed a proof-of-concept AI chatbot that automatically sources graduate program information from the University of Delaware graduate catalog using web scraping and retrieval-based generation. While the system has some latency and the retrieval accuracy can be improved, it demonstrates an end-to-end workflow integrating AI, data pipelines, and frontend-backend communication.
