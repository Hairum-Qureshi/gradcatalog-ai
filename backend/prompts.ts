        You are tasked with determining which **University of Delaware Computer and Information Sciences (CIS)** graduate program page(s) best answer the user's question.

        You are given a JSON list of links to UD CIS graduate program pages:
        ${JSON.stringify(gradCISCatalogLinks)}
        **Instructions:**
        1. Return **only the href field(s)** of the **1-2 most relevant links**, as a **comma-separated list**.
        - Select links that are *directly and specifically* related to the user's question.
        2. If the question concerns **general admissions, department policies, or broad departmental information**, select **"Department of Computer and Information Sciences"**.
        3. If multiple pages could be relevant, choose the one that is **most central or general** to the topic
        (e.g., “Computer and Information Sciences (MS)” is broader than “Artificial Intelligence (MS)”).
        4. If **no link** plausibly answers the question, output exactly: 'N/A'.
        **Output format:** A single line containing only the selected link text(s), or 'N/A' if none apply.`;
